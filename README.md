# Smart Commit

Smart Commit is a highly customizable CLI utility for creating Git commits interactively. It offers a range of features to help you produce consistent, well-formatted commit messages while integrating with your workflow. Below is a detailed overview of its features and commands:

## Features

- **Interactive Prompts:**
  - Customize which prompts appear during commit creation (commit type, scope, summary, body, footer, ticket, and CI tests).
  - Automatically suggest a commit type based on staged changes.

- **Template-Based Commit Message:**
  - Define your commit message format using placeholders:
    - {type}: Commit type (e.g., feat, fix, docs, etc.)
    - {scope}: Optional scope (if enabled)
    - {ticket}: Ticket ID (if provided or auto-extracted)
    - {ticketSeparator}: Separator inserted if a ticket is provided
    - {summary}: Commit summary (short description)
    - {body}: Detailed commit message body (if enabled)
    - {footer}: Additional footer information (if enabled)

- **CI Integration:**
  - Optionally run a CI command before executing a commit.

- **Auto Ticket Extraction:**
  - Extract a ticket ID from your branch name using a custom regular expression (if configured).

- **Push Support:**
  - Automatically push commits to the remote repository using the --push flag.

- **Signed Commits:**
  - Create GPG-signed commits using the --sign flag.

- **Commit Statistics:**
  - View commit statistics (e.g., Git shortlog by author or commit activity with ASCII graphs) using the `sc stats` command.

- **Commit History Search:**
  - Search your commit history by:
    - Keyword in commit messages
    - Author name or email
    - Date range
  - Use the `sc history` command for flexible commit searching.

- **Additional Commands:**
  - **Amend:** Interactively amend the last commit, with optional linting support.
  - **Rollback:** Rollback the last commit with an option for a soft reset (keeping changes staged) or a hard reset (discarding changes).
  - **Rebase Helper:** Launch an interactive rebase helper that provides in-editor instructions for modifying recent commits.

- **Local and Global Configuration:**
  - Global configuration is stored in your home directory as ~/.smart-commit-config.json.
  - Override global settings for a specific project by creating a .smartcommitrc.json file in the project root.
  - Configure settings such as auto-add, emoji usage, CI command, commit message template, prompt toggles (scope, body, footer, ticket, CI), linting rules, and ticket extraction regex via the `sc config` command or the interactive setup (`sc setup`).

- **Commit Message Linting:**
  - Optionally enable linting to enforce rules such as maximum summary length, lowercase starting character in the summary, and ticket inclusion when required.

## Commands

- **sc commit (or sc c):**
  - Start the interactive commit process.
  - Prompts for commit type, scope, summary, body, footer, ticket, CI tests, and staging changes.
  - Supports auto-add, signed commits, and CI integration.

- **sc amend:**
  - Amend the last commit interactively.
  - Opens the current commit message in your default editor for modifications.
  - Validates the amended commit message with linting rules if enabled.

- **sc rollback:**
  - Rollback the last commit.
  - Offers a choice between a soft reset (keeping changes staged) and a hard reset (discarding changes).

- **sc rebase-helper:**
  - Launch an interactive rebase helper.
  - Provides instructions and options (pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop) for modifying recent commits.

- **sc stats:**
  - Display commit statistics.
  - Options include viewing a shortlog by author or commit activity graphs over a selected period (day, week, month).

- **sc history:**
  - Search commit history with flexible options.
  - Choose to search by a keyword in commit messages, by author, or by a date range.

- **sc config (or sc cfg):**
  - View and update global Smart Commit settings.
  - Configure options such as auto-add, emoji usage, CI command, commit message template, prompt settings, linting, and ticket extraction regex.

- **sc setup:**
  - Run the interactive setup wizard to configure your Smart Commit preferences.
